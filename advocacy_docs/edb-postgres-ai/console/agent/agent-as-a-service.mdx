## Running Beacon Agent as a service

To have Beacon Agent run automatically on startup and restart after error, you need to make it a service.

!!! Note
Future versions of the agent package may set this up automatically.
!!!

What follows is an example of how to run Beacon Agent as a service, specifically on an Ubuntu 22.04 machine. Follow the instructions above for setting up a machine user and then installing, configuring, testing, and running Beacon Agent before moving on to set up Beacon as a service. These instructions assume you have completed the last two sections and installed Beacon Agent on a Ubuntu 22.04 machine.

1. We are running the agent on the same server as the Postgres instance we're monitoring. So it's faster and more secure to have Beacon agent use Postgres local auth rather than set up password auth over TCP/IP.

    !!! Note
    In this example, we use the 'ubuntu' user that is created by default on the EC2 with a default Ubuntu (22.04) machine image. In production, you'd want to use a minimally privileged user explicitly created for the purposes of running Beacon Agent on the server.
    !!!

    To configure for local authentication, add the user, `ubuntu`, to Postgres using `psql` and then exit:
    
    ```
    sudo su postgres
    psql -c 'CREATE USER ubuntu'
    exit
    ```

    To complete the setup for local authentication with Postgres, you need to ensure your `pg_hba.conf` file is configured to allow Unix-domain socket connections. Verify or update the following line in your `pg_hba.conf` file:

    ```
    local   all   all   peer
    ```

    This configuration allows any local system user to connect to any database without a password, provided that a corresponding PostgreSQL role with the same name as the system user exists (in this case, user `ubuntu`).

    Now Postgres is configured to allow local authentication so that Beacon Agent can access it as a service.

1. Create a new file using your text editor of choice (superuser level permissions are necessary here). vi is used in this example:

   ```
   sudo vi /etc/systemd/beacon-agent.service
   ```

1. Populate the new file as follows, specifying the BEACON_AGENT_ACCESS_KEY, then save and exit the editor:

   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=Beacon Agent

   # After networking because we need that
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   # Simple services don't do any forking / background nonsense
   Type=simple

   # User with which to run the service
   User=ubuntu
   
   # Set the working directory for the application
   WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/

   Environment='BEACON_AGENT_ACCESS_KEY=<your-api-key-here>'
   Environment='DSN=<your-dsn-here>'

   # Command to run the application
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/beacon-agent
   
   # Restart policy, only on failure
   Restart=on-failure
   RestartSec=60
   
   [Install]
   # Start the service before we get to multi-user mode
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

1. Run the following commands to reload, enable, and start your new service:

   ```
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable beacon-agent.service
   sudo systemctl start beacon-agent.service
   ```
   
1. Your agent should now be running as a service. Check on the logs by running the following command:

   ```
   journalctl -u beacon-agent.service
   ```

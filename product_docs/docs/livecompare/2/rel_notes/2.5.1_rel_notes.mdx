| Platform Support | LiveCompare is now supported for use on x86 based Debian 12 platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Bug Fix          | Fixed an issue where LiveCompare generates DML with 'None' as the setting for bytea columns instead of null.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 93247/25921    |
| Bug Fix          | Restored the ability to connect to Oracle 10g databases and enforced setting `comparison_algorithm = full_row` for such connections.<br/><br/>**Note:** EDB no longer tests LiveCompare with Oracle 10g. As such, it's no longer on the list of Oracle versions officially supported with LiveCompare. Oracle 10g was previously supported and is expected to continue to work in most cases. However, some limitations may exist. | 99815/31762    |
| Bug Fix          | Fixed the issue caused by the differences in how the primary keys returned by the EDB Postgres Advanced Server and Oracle queries were ordered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                |
| Bug Fix          | Fixed an issue where certain column names were incorrectly being identified as Oracle reserved words.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 102498/34229   |

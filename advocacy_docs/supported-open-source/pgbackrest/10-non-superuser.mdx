pgBackRest supports non-superuser backups and restores. This feature is useful when you want to delegate backup and restore tasks to non-superusers. To configure non-superuser support, you need to grant the necessary permissions to the non-superuser.

For example, to allow the `pgbackrest` user to perform backups and restores, you can grant the following permissions:

```sql
grant pg_read_all_settings to pgbackrest ;
```

For EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14 and later:

```sql
GRANT EXECUTE on FUNCTION pg_switch_wal to pgbackrest;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_start_backup(text, boolean, boolean) to pgbackrest;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_stop_backup(boolean, boolean) TO pgbackrest;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_catalog.pg_create_restore_point(text) TO pgbackrest;
```

For EDB Postgres 15 and earlier:

In EDB Postgres 15 onwards, `pg_start_backup` and `pg_stop_backup` functions are changed to `pg_backup_start` and `pg_backup_stop`.

```sql

GRANT EXECUTE on FUNCTION pg_switch_wal to pgbackrest ;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_backup_start(label text, fast boolean) TO pgbackrest;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_backup_stop(wait_for_archive boolean) TO pgbackrest;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_catalog.pg_create_restore_point(text) TO pgbackrest;
```
